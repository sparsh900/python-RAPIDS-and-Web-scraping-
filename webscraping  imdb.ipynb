Expectations change even slower than reality. Everyone sees the world they have seen it before.2. Everyone plays the game of investment differently. You need to define your game.This is a fantastic book. It's not a book about investments. It is a book about your mind, and mine and how it thinks about money, savings, expenditure and investments. And, it is brilliant. Pick it up now.\\n\",\n",
              "  \"\\n  See guys this book is for those who have had a lot of Thier skin in the game of stock market and thought of creating wealth from it.First level of investor is the one who knows money can be made in the mkt, but doesn't know how and starts to trade without any knowledge.Second level investor have made profit or loss on his capital and starts to find out where did he has gone wrong and starts learning about some basic concepts such as PE ratio.Third level of investor starts finding value in whatever the scrip he has been following and starts finding justification that it is costly or cheap and buy or sell them.Fourth level investor follows and checks if the price have gone up or not very often and loses faith if it doesn't go up after he bought it, and if price doesn't go up he sells it and looks for another one.in a short  span of months. Again goes back to drawing board and finds what went wrong.Then come the whole talk of buffetology and starts to find companies like that and invest in them if he felt that it was cheap.But everyone forgets that buffet is buffet because of his principles and patience which helped him in compounding for very long time such as 70-80 years which very few do it. That's when actually psychology matters and thats what Morgan tries to tell us in this book that more that analysis of the scrip, conviction that you calculated and the patience to hold it at least for several decades remains intact only then the wealth would be created or else you would be just a person among a crowd doing nothing but ordinary things in life. And explains that the world is actually big and we are just a blip in it. It gives us all a great humility and convinces us to be humble and show gratitude to others.\\n\",\n",

              "  \"\\n  The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy. Bought it for INR 460 against MRP of INR 499.\\n\",\n",

              "  '\\n  I personally believe that having a purpose on in life and then giving it your all is the most important to lead a happy life. This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it’s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you’ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan’s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you’ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it’s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it’s very cozy. In it’s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read. I was ready to take on my tasks stress-free. Though it is not something extremely crazy and different, it definitely is a one-time read for all the hustlers or non-hustlers out there who think they have to punish themselves to get what they want.\\n'],\n",

Indian police is certainly not as naive as has been portrayed here in terms of technological knowledge. And why the hell does the protagonist always get into an affair with the lady and end up failing, ultimately. One gets a feeling that the entire story until the last few chapters are actually rubbish with almost nothing of it contributing to what actually happened. The ideas by which the culprits are nabbed are actually extremely naive and rather points towards a Bollywood kind of storytelling. And as always, the ending is extremely rushed and leaves nothing on the character development aspect at all. Just too many flaws.The audience Chetan caters too are far too generous by giving him 4+ stars for stories that are purely average. This is mainly because a majority of his reader base have never read books or classics from other authors. In other words, they don't seem to be hardened readers.

The article on habits where he mentions process is important than goals was my starting point.  I continued reading his updates through the consistent newsletter he publishes through his site.Once the book was announced and available it was a no brainer for me to purchase my own copy to have all the concepts in one place and to go through the ideas in succession.This book provides supplementary material like cheat sheet and templates which are very useful for planning your own habit profile and continuous improvement.This book is action oriented.  The concepts present an action plan for trying them in your own situation and to practice the ideas directly in day to day life.  This makes the book an instruction manual for nurturing good habits and killing bad habits.  I was able to immediately relate to many new habits to start and many not so good habits I can stop and avoid using the identification pattern provided in the book.The principle presented in the book about understanding who to become, that is finding out what identity to achieve instead of just starting or stopping a habit is very helpful.One important aspect of this book is the to the point summary provided after every chapter.  Once you have read the book this summary helps recall all the concepts in short time and becomes a concise model to revise the concepts.The book is engaging and is suitable for reading cover to cover as it provides many stories and references.  As the concept of process than goals was already known to me through the Learning How to Learn MOOC at Coursera, I was glad to find the same concept mentioned in this book and was able to relate quickly with the principles.The book also becomes a workbook and reference material once you have gone through it.  The chapters are divided into sections which can be referred for particular situation in hand.I will recommend this book for anyone who is eager to understand why habits are formed and how to nurture good habits and avoid bad ones.\\n',\n",

              "  '\\n  There are too many things one can learn from “The Alchemist”. Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the “beginners luck” and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives.Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable.\\n',\n",
              "  '\\n  This book is not for you if you are looking for a way to escape reality by immersing into a juicy plot during the week end. This book is about you, me and anyone and everyone .It is about our life, our troubles and tribulations, our goals and the purpose of our existence. To determine our goal ( or Personal Legend as Coelho terms) and to pursue and achieve it is not difficult if we are focused because in the words of Coelho,\"..... when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"The story is that of a shepard boy named, Santiago ,from Andulasia. The boy embarks upon a journey in search of a treasure that he had dreamt of. Each one of us are, infact, Santiago, unable to realise when and where we spilt \\'the spoon of oil \\'. As you go through the book you learn that all is not lost and there is hope.Narrated in a simple lucid manner,the story is interspersed with metaphors ,fables and allegories. Compelling, interesting and full of hope and positivity, The Alchemist is a bedrock of inspiration that instills a strong sense of faith in yourself.Such is the power of this book that you will want to read it again and again. Paulo Coelho has an uncanny knack to soothe your soul and boost your morale. This book, in my opinion, should be read by everyone, young and old, atleast once .\\n'],\n",

              "  '\\n  This book is written by Jeff Keller who is a motivational speaker, which is evident through the motivational tone of the book. After graduating from law school in 1980, he practiced for a few years. Feeling unhappy with his career in law, he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling. The numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and researchWhat do I like about this book?- The overall motivational tone of the book, that creates a positive drive within yourself- To-the-point crisp writing, without being verbose at all (unlike some other books which keep reiterating the same points through multiple pages)- Powerful examples from history- Great quotes by famous men. It is just a treat to read all these famous words by eminent people.- The book justifies its title ‘Attitude is everything’ through its content.What I did not like about the book?Well, honestly, NOTHING. I’m usually critical of books if I find any flaws with the writing, or content, or engagement, but I didn’t find anything lacking in this one. Hence, the complete five stars. The book is beautifully written with meaningful content.The book begins with a famous quote by Thomas Jefferson – “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” In the first chapter, Jeff Keller talks about his own circumstances that led to his career change, finally becoming a motivational speaker. He mentions general problems faced by common people in their day to day lives and hence creates a bond with the reader.The book is primarily divided into 3 parts and 12 lessons. Each part includes various lessons, which are thought-provoking. The basic message conveyed through these three parts and lessons is – “When you THINK, SPEAK, and ACT in ways that support your success, you’re firing on all cylinders and on the way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.”PART 1 – SUCCESS BEGINS IN THE MIND: THINKINGIn this part, the author tries to teach us that success begins in the mind, and he focuses on the power of attitude and belief in shaping your destiny.Lesson 1 – Your Attitude is your window to the world.Attitude is like a mental filter through which you experience the world around you. Some people see the world through a filter of optimism while others have a more pessimist outlook. A person with positive attitude thinks ‘I CAN’ while the others think ‘I CAN’T’. We all start off with a clean window when we are young, and as we grow old, life throws some dirt on the window (like criticism, ridicule from peers, rejections, disappointments), and we start doubting our capabilities, we start having negative outlook towards thinks, and we are not as confident as we used to be earlier. The advice given in the lesson is to wash our mental window, so we can control our mental attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his/her reactions to different things happening all around.One of the many Examples cited – Dr. Viktor Frankl’s (Author of Man’s Search for Meaning – would recommend people to read this) experiences during concentration camp.Lesson 2 – You are a human magnet.The message of this lesson can be summed up in a single quote by Earl Nightingale – “We become what we think about.” Jeff states the idea of ‘dominant thought’. He says, your dominant thoughts rule the day. Your beliefs brought you to where you are today, and your thinking from this point forward will take you where you will be in the future. As human magnets, we have the power to attract success through our thoughts. If you think about positive things, positive outcomes, success – same shall follow. However, he rightly warns against the expectation of overnight success too.Lesson 3 – Picture your way to success.The author asks the readers to create mental movies in the mind, picturing things and milestones they wished to achieve. At the same time, we have to get rid of our old rubbish mental images, which remind us of failure, negativity, and disappointments.One of the many Examples cited – Story of singer Celine Dion where she mentions that from the age of five, she had always imagined singing in front of houseful audience, receiving multiple awards and becoming a superstar. Another example quoted is of Jim Carrey, who wrote a post-dated cheque to himself for $10 Million, which acted as a source of inspiration for him.Lesson 4 - Make A Commitment And You Will Move Mountains.Jeff mentions the book ‘The ultimate secret to getting absolutely everything you want’ by Mike Hemaki. He says, the key to getting what you want is the ‘willingness to do whatever it takes’ to accomplish your goals. When you commit to something, positive events start happening, the whole universe conspires to make it happen.He gives the example of Benjamin Roll who cleared the bar council exam in his 14th attempt at the age of 74! Another example cited is that of ‘Baldacci’ who became a writer, by learning the craft of writing, through sheer commitment.Lesson 5 - Turn Your Problems Into Opportunities.Whenever something goes wrong, we start questioning ourselves, our circumstances and at times our luck. In such a situation, we have two choices – 1. Keep feeling miserable or 2. Learn a lesson from the problem and move on. A problem should be seen as an opportunity to learn, improve, and do something better next time. Adversity encourages us to make necessary changes in our life, tap our hidden potential. It teaches us to be grateful for the small things and helps us build self-esteem and confidence.As Napolean said, “Every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.”PART 2 – WATCH YOUR WORDS: SPEAKINGIn this part, the author focuses on what we speak. What we say, directly shows how we think, and precedes our actions.Lesson 6 – Your Worlds Blaze A Trails.The author says that words have immense power. They can build your future, destroy opportunities or help maintain the status quo. Your choice of words defines your personality.Always remember – Thoughts > Words > Beliefs > Actions > ResultsThe author cites an inspirational example of Kent Cullers, a scientist at NASA.Lesson 7 – How are you?Jeff says that this question is the most frequently asked questions to any person, and what reply a person gives to this question is extremely important. Now, a reply to this question can be – Positive, Mediocre or Negative. We should avoid negative answers as they drain the energy of others as well. Jeff says that we should always reply to this question with words such as ‘Terrific’ or ‘Great’ or other such positive words. This will help boost our confidence and create a positive outlook.Lesson 8 – Stop complaining.Nobody wants to hear about our pains and problems. As William Penn said, “the secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.” Jeff says that complaining is a major problem in all of us, whereas it doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t help the person ranting about his problems, and definitely doesn’t help the listener who’s least interested in listening to someone else’s problems when he has plenty of his own. However, at the same time, the author clarifies that sharing your problems with your nearest ones, is different from complaining, and rightly so.PART 3 – HEAVEN HELPS THOSE WHO ACT: ACTIONIn this part, the author emphasizes on the fact that without action, positive thoughts and words will not help you attain the level of success you aimed for.Lesson 9 - Associate with Positive People.We are the average of the people we spend our most time with. The people you hang out with define your outlook and future because they greatly influence our thoughts and life. Hence, it is very important to be in the company of positive people, who have definite goals for themselves. Hanging around folks with no ambition or goals, who imbibe negativity in you, will put you on the path of failure.Lesson 10 - Confront Your Fears and Grow.The path that leads to success is often filled with obstacles. The people who succeed, do so by overcoming these obstacles. If you want to achieve something, you have to get out of your ‘comfort zone’. You have to stretch yourself. Adopt a mindset that helps you acquire what you want. Remember, repetition is the key, like any other muscle. It will build up and encourage you to do something great.Lesson 11 – Get out there and fail.Winston Churchill said, - “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” In order to success someday, you must be willing to fail today. Successful people around the world are wise enough to know that success doesn’t come in one shot. You have pe persevere, fail again and again, learn from your failures, and work on it again with double enthusiasm.The author cites an example of TV talk show host ‘Sally Jessy Raphael’, who was fired 18 times, couldn’t pay her credit card bills for 26 years, lived on food stamps, before finally making it big in the industry.Lesson 12 - Networking That Gets Results.This lesson shows the importance of teamwork. It shows, if you’re positive and ready to help people, people, in turn, will go out of their way to help you back. Some key points from this lesson –- Develop a win-win attitude.- Effectively participate in a group or organization.- Do not stop the flow of messages, you should keep in touch with your peers.- Become a good listener.- Congratulate people on for their accomplishment.- Make new friends in your field.- Do more for others, before expecting something in return.In my opinion, this is one of the best self-improvement books ever written. The content of this book far outweighs its price, and although I have provided the summary for a quick glance, you can still go ahead and pick the book for a quick read. There are many more powerful impactful examples cited throughout the book which make this one an interesting read. Recommended!Favorite Quotes from the book:- “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way…. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food, and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis, it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone.”- “When you believe you can do something, you have the courage to move forward despite being afraid.”- “As adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us. At the age of six, we knew we had to fall.”- “Whether you think you can—or think you can’t—you’re right!” – Henry Ford- “You see, when you change your attitude, sparks fly in the universe. You’re energized. You begin to see new possibilities. You move into action. You achieve extraordinary results. That’s why I say when you change your attitude, you change your life!”- “What the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.”- “They can because they think they can.” – Virgil\\n',\n",
              "  '\\n  This book is a quick and short read (144 pages). But man! the lessons written here are so valuable. The author has used simple language. Even the beginners can/should read this book.The major takeaways from this book are-Attitude is everything. Even in the worst cases, you have an option to choose your attitude: how’d you respond to that problem.You can’t ignore negative thoughts altogether. Instead, you can try indulging more positive thoughts. The positive thoughts should dominate your negative thoughts.Visualize your success. Be clear about the things and goals you want to achieveBe committed to yourself. Make “no matter what” type habits. Like, I read and write daily, no matter what. Learn how to turn your problems into opportunities. Adversities change our perspectives and teach us important life-lessons.Your words carry more importance than you realize. Always be careful and keep a check on what words are you using often and they tend to imply.Whenever someone asks “Hey, how are you?” Reply with “Amazing! Awesome! Wonderful!” instead of plain”fine, or Okay”. Heck, I often reply with “I am AWESOME!” It feels AMAZING.Stop Complaining. Instead, count your blessings. This one practice can change your whole lifestyle.Heaven helps those who act. Be a man of action.Add up more positive people in your life and cut off the toxic people that are compromising your mental peace.Confront your fears. This is by far one of the most difficult tasks. Do it, and you’ll be way ahead than a lot of people.Get out of your comfort zone. Chances are, you’ll fail, initially. That’s the thing. Come up, fail as quickly as possible, and then learn from it. Improve accordingly.Patience and perseverance are the keys to longer run. And, life is not a sprint as we know.\\n',\n",

But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life).

There is no sentence with blanks to fill.2nd. All capital\" I \"written like thia(WIC is correct) but we in books make kids write capital I with sleeping lines on top and bottom. this capital I is same as small letter l. Which looks exactly same. I did not notice it in first go. But wen my son started reading it with phonics he made the sound l instead i then I realised . And this issue is everywhere in the book. It is very confusing when capital I and small l comes together . Kindly refer the picture.

              "  \"\\n  Life. Love. Soul. Eternity.(No spoilers)These words were the constants of the book which spoke and garnered the most attention. Since Perfect Us, Durjoy has been concentrating on a contrasting form of writing which goes into the societal norms with the overlaying structure of love intact. A Touch of Eternity, set in a dystopian future has seen unprecedented success in Science and carved a breakthrough in Reincarnation of soul. The book has a subtle first act of introducing the characters with a good impression for the people to review and connect with. Druvan and Anvesha, born on the same day, have an attachment which goes beyond their timeline. However, greed and contrasting opinions create minor hurdles in their relationship. That is till the second act opens up in its full flourished glory. Durjoy sir really went the distance and crossed unknown boundaries of politics, religion and sanity of the mankind with a relative ease which makes the reader convinced in what the protagonists of the story are trying to talk through. However, some unexplained points and some over explained points create a drab in between the pages. The utopian setting defines the idea with ease but execution is a little bit messed up. But as Durjoy sir is a master of the Third Act of a novel, he executes the same with his finesse and star touch all the same. Druvan and Anvesha go through a real test of time and fate for their choices in the relationship which make you laugh as well as cry. The end really changes the tone of the book as no one could predicted such a dramatic ending.Conclusively, the book follows in the footsteps of Durjoy sir’s previous work, Wish I could Tell You, which makes us think for a relatively more time in comparison to other Coffee table Novels. Also, I have seen Durjoy sir use his Engineering degree in some sense which means that his four years in DTU was not a complete waste. XD.A recommended Novel for people who want to read something afresh in Love stories compared to the half baked tragedies with only boyfriend- girlfriend drama and earth shattering depictions of sexual intercourses. Soulmates is a word which couples often use nowadays for legitimising their relationship and seem it make forever. But it isn’t forever until and unless you live the concept of ' Do Jism, Ek Jaan’.\\n\",\n",

At many times in the book I felt the author departed from what scientific evidence/research supports and instead conveyed a more political/biased view of things.I would have liked to have him bring his educated opinions, emotions and humanity into the book more directly and openly, with facts and ideas that show how he arrived at these beliefs, rather than disguise his emotions as science and cherry pick a few facts to support himself. It cheapened what could otherwise have been a very good, thought provoking and otherwise well written book.Given his next book is about the future, I am going to avoid it. In the middle of the book, I even wanted to give it up. Towards the end I had to push myself through the book.\\n'],\n",

But ain't too sure whether I will continue to do so in times to come!!However, for one, I would say that the title 'One Arranged Murder' isn't too apt for the book. It kinda gives away certain aspects. The reader, ab initio, knows that the death is a murder, whereas the book takes too long to establish this fact.Secondly, Chetan seems to have written it keeping a Hindi Movie producer in mind who would buy the rights for a hefty sum. Thus, it looses it's ingenuity there.The book has all the typical Hindi Movie masala in abundance. Pre marital & Extramarital Sex, drugs, murder, incest, two wannabe detectives, dysfunctional family, children born out of wedlock, deceit and what have you.But my compliments for a very lucid writing. It's a good one time read. The twists, too, are well thought out. However, the end seems a trifle too contrived.Go for it if you are a Chetan Bhagat fan.\\n\"],\n",

It\\'s very inspiring.*Book: \"You either get the idea in the first five minutes, or you don\\'t get it at all\", said Warren Buffet in the epilogue.- I would add - you don\\'t necessarily need to read all 550 pages, but you must read through the idea of value investing - and it will change your way of looking at the world.- I always felt confused and amazed by listening to all the ridiculous fuzz that comes from the Wall Street through TV and the internet. The book explains why.🔴Several rules I noted into my keep: ፨ - Investor buys the business [based on its price/value], speculator buys the stock [based on an absurd believe that he can foresee where the stock price will go]. ፨ - The best way to earn adequate return without any trouble whatsoever is to invest into cheap (low maintenance cost) indexes; use dollar averaging (buy every month instead of once at a random point of time) for smoothing the luck involved. ፨ - For enterprising investor (willing to spend much more time), look for a diversified list of bargain issues (at least 30 issues, business values (i.e. net current asset and other related metrics) is below market cap) ፨ - During the bubble, hot industries and companies are getting overpriced. That could only be financed from somewhere. Partially that money are coming from well established old economy companies that lose the appeal. Thus, invest in such old economy companies while bubble grows, as soon as the bubble burst - undervalued companies would rise back. ፨ - Don\\'t ever buy IPOs! (See chapter for compelling arguments) ፨ - Don\\'t consider companies that do not pay dividends. Dividends - money firm pays you for providing capital, they belong to you. They cut a piece for reinvestment - payout ratio. If firm doesn\\'t pay dividends - invest all into growth so you could profit later - that\\'s a speculation. Moreover stock price would be more volatile because it should now rely on future rather than current prospects.The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, is probably the most important and influential value investing book ever written even Warren Buffet described it as “by far the best book ever written on investing”. ፨ If you could only buy one investment book in your lifetime, this would probably be the one. ፨ It had been 6 months since I last read The Intelligent Investor. I have  enjoyed my personal “refresher course” in value investing.🔴Objective of The Intelligent Investor Book ፨ Benjamin Graham’s objective was to provide an investment policy book for the ordinary investor. ፨ He succeeded in putting seemingly hard concepts into terms that could be understood and, more importantly, implemented by the average investor. ፨ The typical investor has a tendency to “follow the market” when they should be employing portfolio risk management strategies. Instead, Graham gives us an alternative based on fundamental stock analysis. ፨ The goal is to learn how to avoid the pitfalls of allowing our emotions to control our investment decisions. Rather, Graham provides the foundation for making businesslike decisions.🔴The Intelligent Investor puts special emphasis on teaching:1. Risk management through asset allocation and diversification.2. Maximizing probabilities through valuations analysis and margin of safety.3. A disciplined approach that will prevent consequential errors to a portfolio.🔴If you have any Doubt regarding this Review or this Product, then Feel Free to Contact me or Just ask me by commenting below.I Hope this Review was Helpful.Write reviews, help others, happy shopping.Thank You for Reading this Review.-●➽ʙʜᴀᴠᴇsʜ ʙ.ᴏ.ᴛ 🔥\\n',\n",
              "  \"\\n  This book is perhaps the most important and insightful book on investing, and an eternal classic. It is not a book that promises ‘How to become rich…’ or ‘Mastering Stock market in a week….’ or ‘Beating the market made easy…’ or any shortcut to a quick buck. The book teaches three powerful lessons of how one can:- minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses- maximize the chance of achieving sustainable gains- practice emotional control and behavior to help the investor achieve full potential.The book is about investing and having said that, investing is for the long term. Short term investing is like saying one is a spendthrift miser. While long term investors buy stocks or bonds for its intrinsic value and hold them, the 'short termers' play on its price like a video game, high on dopamine, ‘seeing price patterns’. While the intrinsic value of the security is stable, the markets, built upon the greed and fear of speculators, fluctuate widely and it is this constant flow of price movements that is the juice of speculation.The intelligent investor is the one who estimates the value of a stock based on some key parameters like the company’s long-term prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend.Graham lists two types of intelligent investors. The ‘active’ or ‘enterprising’ who does continuous researching, selecting and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The ‘passive’ or ‘defensive’ investor on the other hand, creates a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement) argues the author so elegantly. Quoting the investment thinker Charles Ellis, ‘’the enterprising approach is physically and intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally demanding’’.For the long-term defensive investor, who has abundant emotional courage not to be distracted by daily price movements, there is no need to look at the daily price. In fact, the investor ‘’would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would be spared the mental anguish caused by other persons’ mistakes of judgement.’’ We don’t check the price of our house every hour! The intelligent investor would make use of any opportunity if a good company is facing a temporary crisis and add more shares to his portfolio at lower price. (In cases of extreme exuberance, it is also wise to sell if the price seems too high to be real). A prudent investment methodology would be to add on more of high quality stocks on a regular basis, thus paving way for ‘dollar cost averaging’. A well-diversified stock and bond portfolio ensures long term risk mitigation.Though the book is highly acclaimed in investment circles, in practice, only a miniscule of market participants adhere to the key principles the world over. Hence, situations like the Dot com bubble, the financial crisis of the last decade and the collapse of  high priced so called ‘high growth stocks’ of unworthy and nefarious companies happen repeatedly.‘’A man is known by the books he reads” said Ralph Waldo Emerson. Invest in companies that have proven track record, stellar management capabilities and high ethical standards of corporate citizenry. Being an intelligent investor is more a matter of ‘character’ than ‘brain’, is the key message of this great tome.\\n\",\n",

And that will be more clear to you when you will read this book.It has 13 Chapters starting with “The wake up call, The mysterious visitor, The miraculous transformation of Julian Mantle, A magical meeting with the sages of sivana, A spiritual student of the sages, The wisdom of personal change, A most Extraordinary garden, Kindling your inner fire, The ancient art of Self-leadership, The power of discipline, Your most precious commodity, The ultimate purpose of life, The timeless secret of lifelong happiness.All these chapters are so beautifully penned down that while reading I felt that Julian is narrating his journey, sitting right in front of me.This book has everything which will make you inspired to fulfil all your dreams.\\n',\n",

Although the novel received more criticism than praise during its first year of publication, it later became one of the most significant novels that contributed to the ideology of emancipating from the implicit manacles set by the Victorian period. It is one of those rare gems in literature that takes pride in its idiosyncrasy and conspicuously demands to be recollected time and again. In a way by writing Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte endorses that readers can elucidate the novel in whichever way they want, and thus, can formulate their own opinions and conclusions about the novel. It is not restrained, it is not shackled, nor is it fixed. It does not revolve around a specific Victorian genre or theme, nor is it fixated on a definite structure which would have been deemed acceptable in the late 18th to early 19th century Victorian period.The Penguin Cloth bound format is really good but the corners does crease over time.

I read Bhagat Singh's Jail notes, Why I am an atheist, and Without fear.3.  I completely agreed with what B.R. Ambedkar said in his interview with BBC in the year 1955.All the above person's beliefs were totally against Gandhi.  With so many doubts I started reading Gandhi's story and guilt was what left with me when I finished reading.Guilt for forming a wrong opinion about Gandhi merely by seeing only one side of the coin.

To name a few, his behaviour with his wife at times when she was forced into those aspects of community service which she, being a human, had all the rights to deny. Also, the failure of the father and a teacher to impart proper education to his own children despite the fact that he had all the means to provide for the same and the fact that he himself had studied to the highest levels possible in his field with proper degrees.Overall, a good account of the life of a simple but powerful man.\\n'],\n",

              "  \"\\n  Young children will identify with Nooni's freedom of living as she wants in the village, with no routine to follow. They are sure to sympathize with her feeling of abandonment when her parents leave her at her grandparent's home due to their busy professional lives and their inability to take her for a vacation.The main problem that Nooni faces is her inability to go ahead with the entire excavation of the ruins she and her friends stumbled upon by chance despite having an eighteen-year-old boy in their team of children. This is similar to most of the problems children usually face in which they have to take the help of the elderly or the experienced to achieve certain goals.Though hesitant at first, she ultimately solves the problem by involving her grandparents, who in turn involve the village people as well as her parents, in order to get the job done.Sometimes it is so easy to read and get lost in a children's fiction too, despite being an adult. Like in this book, especially at my age, I can feel my thoughts being reflected by the main (young) character, about 'How is it possible for everyone to be at the top?' while she remembers her father's words about how 2000 people apply where 20 vacancies are there for a job and how you have to be at the top, in order to get a good job!\\n\"],\n",

Those are *Body, *Mind, & *Energy...*Body : Sadhguru says...Body is the only thing that is visible and can easily controlled... Every human being has 5 senses i.e., 1) Touch, 2) Sight, 3) hearing, 4) Taste, and 5) Smell... If these 5 senses stops working then it is hard for one to realize actually what and who you are... So, these 5 senses plays a important role in life... and hence one should maintain them very well...one must gain focus & control over these senses or else it will impact on one's Mind and Energy...*Mind : Sadhguru says...(Sadhguru) Shares and very interesting and funny story of A man wants to acquire Supernatural powers from a Spiritual guru... (pl. read the book for the story)What ever you input to your brain the same output it gives... if you input positive thoughts only positive will be outcome... and vice versa...*Energy : Sadhguru says...If one uses energy in right direction it gives benefit and if one uses it in wrong direction one will suffer... Here Sadhguru treated Energy as Karma... and said If one do good to others the same will return to him/her... and vice versa...The best part of the book is in Sadhana : A small exercise which helps one to do meditation... and there are bunch of sadhanas shared in this book...My thoughts : If you are a follower of Sadhguru, then you like this book, If you are not, then I don't recommend this book to you... (Now this is totally subjective), Because at the last chapter Sadhguru talks about occult powers which I personally Didn't like, apart from that, this book is OK and pl. don't buy this book with full expectations... you may get disappointed).I don't recommend this book to every one but only to sadhguru followers... and do recommend following books to read...* Life's Amazing secrets - Gaur Gopal Das* The power of Now - Eckhart Tolle* Think and grow rich - Napoleon Hill* The power of subconscious mind - Joseph Murphy* Jonathan Livingston seagull - Richard Bach\\n\",\n",

              "  \"\\n  I'm a self-improvement junkie who hates self-help books. Most self-help books (if not all) masquarades poor advice and wishful thinking as a path to self-progress. Every now and then I torture myself reading self-help books to reinforce my above thoughts about self-help books. Luckily I came across this book as strong recommendation from a twitter account which I really value a lot. And I'm glad that I took the recommendation.Deep Work is a common sense book than a self-help book. The crux of the book is that there are two kind of work we do. One is Deep work and the other is shallow work. Deep work is rare and hard. Shallow work is easy and ubiquitous.What is Deep Work? Deep work is concentrating on a cognitively demanding work with zero distractions to produce quality work. Its demanding and helps provide valuable things to society that are hard to replicate or replace.What Shallow work? Any work we do on auto-pilot. Replying emails , social media presence etc. These work are easy to replace and not valued much in society.The book is dividend into two parts. Part I is about why Deep work matter and its scientific backing. Part II is how to achieve Deep work.Part I doesn't have to try hard to convince us about the internet chipping away our ability to concentrate and contemplate. And provides all the necessary studies and research on internet and its effects on attention. Most of the critique are well ground and rational, and definitely not a luddite rant on the internet.Part II is how to achieve Deep Work.Discusses on what type of Deep work philosophy to choose.Ritualising Deep work: Identify Location and time to do deep work. Adhere to rules and process to deep work. (like no internet)4DX fundamentals: Focus unimportant things, Act on measures, Keep a scorecard, Create accountability.Embrace Boredom:Don't take break from distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus. Schedule your internet usage. Structure your deep thinking.Quit Social Media.Drain the Shallows: Schedule your day in blocks in advance to focus on Deep work.Although it follows the typical science/self-help format with familiar paragraphs like 'The Study conducted by University of X researchers on group of people in Y of the age Z in ABC environment agrees with my thesis', this is a potent work with strong common sense solutions to the ubiquitous problem of shallow work. My thoughts on self-help books remains unchanged. However I would highly recommend this book.\\n\",\n",
              "  '\\n  Genre: Productivity | Creativity | Hacks | Self Development | BusinessRating : 5/5Deep work is a book for everyone although the author emphasises it for knowledge workers. In my opinion it is for businessmen who wants to achieve their goals in their hectic schedule, teachers (faculties) who wants to pursue research despite their academic duties, or an entrepreneur who wants to increase the productivity and creativity of the team, or just some random guy who wants to spend some quality time with family but cannot. Books helps you to develop self discipline.This book can best be placed among books like Outliers/Mastery/Flow/Peak etc. where importance of work and it’s consequences are explained. Only thing is Deep work is more detailed in terms of strategies and bit less on psychology studies.The book is hardly 300 pages but will require some time to fully understand all hacks & strategies. Work habits of great people like Carl Jung, J K Rowling, Bill Gates, Walter Isaacson and many others are very well explained. The author also writes about his life and experience.After reading this book you will definitely be more productive, you might be able schedule every minute/hour/day of your life, you would be able to effectively choose your career job and not fall for dead end jobs, and lastly decipher what is fact from fiction when it comes to big companies.After completing this book and from my experience at different work places I think the book may be a bit ambitious for developing & undeveloped countries. This is because I think in this countries there is still lack of work ethics and your company/institute may not respond as the book says or they may not even consider deep work as meaningful. All in all deep work gives a positive experience.\\n',\n",
              "  '\\n  A timely book that helped me immensely. The ideas are not really difficult to implement but our mind is so used to craving for distraction that it becomes difficult to continue in this deep work mode. And that is where the strength of the book lies in. It not only lists down the steps needed but already predicts what kind of obstructions will come up and how to handle those. Cal has really made it fool proof system if you can vow to follow it.To those saying that it is repetitive in the first part, I believe it is really necessary to convince us in all ways possible. Because everyone knows deep work is good just like everyone knows exercise and eating balanced diet are good but no one does them. You really need to be convinced in order to make permanent lifestyle change.\\n'],\n",

The novel provides valuable information about the holocaust, the Nazi regime and the horrors the Jews had to face. From the book we understand that Jews during the time were not allowed to use public transport and it was mandatory for Jews to wear a yellow badge on their garments so as to identify them as Jews in public.Writing Style:Anne Frank was obviously a very talented writer. Anne had such mature views about life and relations ship. Due to the outstanding nature of the writing many had criticized that the book was fabricated. The diary was then subjected to forensic studies and proved otherwise. The writing style is simple and easy to comprehend, written from a first person perspective.My Thoughts:Anne Frank’s Diary is a heart rending and moving read. Thinking of a little girl surviving in a cramped space with constant fear of being caught almost brought tears to my eyes. Sometimes life was so hard for Anne that for a moment, she thinks it might have been better if she had died instead of hiding in the Annex.

I could tell from the start what was going to happen.Writing was not that amusing too. I find it simple and well it's a good thing. I don't mind simple writing as long as plotline is good.But here that was not the case. Just after reading two or three pages I started cringing.

It helps you see the world through the eyes of someone whose fairytale turns into a horror story. It helps you gain a new perspective and shows how easily people judge others without even imagining themselves in other\\'s shoes.I love the way in which the author has told this story.

Then let me inform you friends that \"ANYTHING BUT CONTENT \" is present in this book . The book starts with a story at a pace so slow that it tests your patience to the extent of boredom . But I kept my patience and continued . And you know what I found ? Initial part of book is full of long insipid monologues and YOU CAN SKIP FIRST 8 CHAPTERS ( 26% OF BOOK ) WITHOUT ANY GUILT . The author present only vague data and fancy quotes copied from internet or bestseller books . There is NO SOLID , RELIABLE & PRACTICAL ADVICE as you expect from a (highly marketed ) Master called Robin Sharma . This is not a time management / life management book . It seems to be a boring travelogue of some eccentric rich person. The idea of its creators is \" WHEN YOU ARE LACKING A SCRIPT ; THEN CREATE A SCENE \" . Let me elaborate this . Here is a piece from masterpiece taken as it is . { An assistant wearing a crisp shirt the color of the sky and pressed Bermuda shorts the hue of a tomato, with red leather sandals, ran down from the home of the titan of industry. } I must tell you that almost 80 % of the book is full of such paragraphs where Cars , Helicopters , Beaches , islands , vineyards , female character\\'s blouse fitting is discussed when you are expecting some life changing advice .  There is also a Non sense chapter on Taj Mahal . I want to ask the author what emperor Shah Jahan\\'s (debatable) love for his wife has to do with my morning routine ?In the conclusion , I must say that author didn\\'t put serious efforts while writing this book . When you are popular celebrity ; you develop a tendency to RELY MORE ON MARKETING & LESS ON CRAFT . And that\\'s what Sharma Ji did . It is an avoidable book .

The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman\\'s act of violence against her husband - and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive...Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...Review:The perfect catch of the book is in starting itself to reveal the heinous crime done by protagonist Alicia Berenson. It was clear to the investigating team that Alicia was the accused and the gripping theme of the book is that she does not speak. That becomes the mere mystery. It was made out from her silence that there was more to the story and behind the murder of his husband Gabrial.The story narrated by Theo Faber is really hooking. I enjoyed the history of Theo Faber and his motivation to become Psychotherapist. A genuine lover. Any girl would long for. He is another protagonist of the book. His efforts to save Alicia and make her talk is the main thriller of the book because that reveals the line sequence of Alicia\\'s life before killing her husband.I read such an intriguing book after a long time. This reminded me of \"The girl on the train\"Overall, I loved the writing style of the book, The sequence of incidents mentioned. The characters of the book are all independent, determined and tough. To take the situation under control no matter the consequences. All the characters were really provoking in the sense of living up to the things we ever wanted. This book is excellent from an entertainment point of view, heavy to handle because it has heart-breaks and also concludes how to be like Theo. Even after having a difficult childhood, Theo gets out so strong with the help of Ruth and also manages to save his married life. I really really loved Theo. A lot!!!Apart from the sudden twist in the story, my part love for this book exists because of the quotes and psychological way of writing it.Book rating- 5/5 for the love of Theo!!!\\n',\n",

For a person like me who is regularly following and reading about the stuff, keeps knowing new things every day and also getting refreshed with all the previously learnt concepts. Every time, I pick up a spiritual book or a book by a spiritual personality, it is my basic expectation to learn and know something new which can surprise, shock, astonish and mind-boggle me. If nothing of that sort happens, the book is a failure for me which is written not to introduce new concepts to human beings but just for sake of writing a book to accomplish one of the personal goals and yearly resolutions.Same has been the case after reading “Life’s Amazing Secrets” written by none other than one of the most popular spiritual personality on Youtube- Gaur Gopal Das. I have been following two personalities on Youtube when it comes to spiritual knowledge- No one can beat my following for Sadhguru and 2nd, this gentleman- Gaur Gopal Das. He has such a polite and well-speaking oratory skills that you can hear him for hours. Also, his concepts, examples and logics that he gives in his videos are so up to the mark that it teaches you something new each time you watch one of his new videos. Though I do not like the way ISKCON endorses spiritualism by circulating the knowledge only from the one dimension that they believe in but still, this man speaks individually by not bonding himself under the premise of the institution’s agenda. Unfortunately, everything that I have spoken about his powerful knowledge sharing capacity in his videos cannot be said for his debut book.The book gives me a very basic knowledge of how to lead life which you have yourself kept hearing since childhood from your parents and colony’s uncles and aunts. Not a single chapter in the book is as impactful as such self-help and spiritual book are expected of. As Das has himself said in the start of the book that writing the book was not his original thought, but the publisher asked him to, this book also displays the same that author just completed it for the sake of at least start with writing books. Author has gone the Robin Sharma way where he has written the book in the conversational format still dividing it into different chapters but couldn’t deliver the same simple keys that can help us in changing our lifestyle and approach towards living.The author has spoken about the four basic wheels of life in the book:- Balancing personal life, maintaining relationships, regulating work life and managing social contributions. The only section that I found little different than what I have regularly read is the one talking about managing work life. Except that, there is a section in which the author has described how should one sit in an asana and release the stress off which also sounded solution-proof. Otherwise, at the end of each chapter, author has summarized the whole chapter, and I am sorry to say, but if you only read those 4-5 bulleted points in the summary, you are done with the book as it has nothing more than that. This is a very confused book where author has also ended up giving examples or real-life scenarios which are not even completely relevant to the stuff he is talking about. Overall, I would say a very disappointing debut and I give this book only 2 stars out of 5.Thanks.ABHILASH RUHELA!!!\\n',\n",
              "  \"\\n  This book is simply and slowly make us realise what all wrong we are doing in life, how wrong we are living our relationships. And, then tell us the best way to over come it. The book explains us the four wheels of life, where we have to control the steering wheel. The best part i found was the two worksheets given at the end of the book i.e. One us forgiveness worksheet, which helps you to forgive the people and second is Ikigai, this is basically a Japanese word which means 'reason to live' and is best explained in the book. With every chapter comes a tagline which give you insights about the content following and a beautiful quote.  . I want to include two lines i really loved from the book as follows:1)People don't care what you know, unless they know what you care.2) we don't see things as they are we see things as we are.Not just these two lines but on every page of this treasure writer put forth the amazing lessons, stories and secrets which is tremendous.\\n\",\n",

              "  '\\n  Any review of Sherlock Holmes must fall short. How can you capture a volcano , an inferno... nature itself it words ? Let me like Holmes focus on the rational aspects first . Holmes lives on for over a 100 years because of 3 main factors 1 ) His brilliance  2 ) His eccentricity & 3 ) His language . I have read each & every story at least 20 times & still the fascination endures . It is beneficial for every human being to read it . If not for the sheer pleasure than for the learnings . What do you learn ? The beauty of the English language . The way a brilliant brain works. How can you become more observant . How can you become more rational . Several scientists have decoded Holmes\\' way of thinking & plenty of neuroscientists have concurred that his method of thinking is excellent as backed by the latest research . Want some creative ideas ? Daydream over the problem suggested by Tony Buzan  \" Its quite a 3 pipe problem \" - The Red Headed League . Want to problem solve ? First gather data THEN start thinking about it . Quite like David Allen\\'s natural planning method of CCORE . Capture , clarify, organise, reflect & engage - all the better with mind maps .  \" It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment\" A Study In Scarlet . Want to know the # 1 secret to success according to Roy Baumeister - one of the top 100 most influential psychologists alive today .It is Hard Work . \"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains\" A Study In Scarlet . It is astounding how brilliant Sir Doyle was to have untuitively understood so much . Finally I end my review with envy . Yes envy for the person who has still not met the austere figure in his digs at 221 B . If there is cerebral heaven on earth - it is here !\\n',\n",

Now years later, I bought this beautiful vintage classics edition and read it for the upteenth time.Mr. Bennet is the father of five daughters living on a modest income, he is married to Mrs. Bennet whose only goal in life is to get her daughters married . She finds her prayers answered when a young bachelor, a Mr. Bingley comes in their neighbourhood with his sisters and a friend Mr. Darcy and so the story begins.This book made a big impact on me when I first read it, it deals with marriage for love vs money, class differences, self evolution of both the male and female protagonist.The characters are written in a very realistic manner , Our heroine is flawed, prejudiced but strong. Elizabeth Bennet is no doormat, she will not marry for comfort and monetary gains but for love.  Mr. Darcy had to be my first fictional crush, an epitome of the strong and silent men. Jane Austen immortalized both of them.The book being published in 1813 is a bit difficult to read for anyone starting on classics but I would urge the reader to give the book some time and it would be worth it.\\n',\n",
              "  \"\\n  Love it, love it, love it! Excellent book. It will keep you glued till the very end. You'll be left wanting for more by the time you finish this. Language can be a bit tricky, nothing a dictionary app cannot fix. The acrid language, piercing detail and the vivid picturization make this a worthwhile read. I'll probably read it again and again many times just for the pure joy of reading - there is something of nice and pleasant flow of her language.Now as for book and printing - very nice. The font used is Sabon instead of something ghastly like Times New Roman. Text size is quite comfortable. Paper quality is nice and has a smooth texture to it, although people accustomed to the bright off-white pages might be a bit disappointed at the not so bright pages. So my suggestion is to buy the penguin edition.\\n\",\n",

Most likely this will be my final impression as well!Who should buy this book?Anybody with interest in reading. If you\\'re capable of reading a book within a month then you could buy!Who shouldn\\'t buy this book?1. This book is not for someone who wants a book as an aid to overcome fear, depression, loneliness, addition, negative thoughts, relationship struggles...2. Introduction to all the problems under the sky or maybe above the sky are written in this book...3. Those who already practice mindfulness, meditation, yoga might not find much stuff in this book...Things that will be interesting...1. You might think that maybe Jay is the wisest person in the universe.2. It\\'s because he didn\\'t dilute the subject matter. But he has made the content more relatable to 2020.Annoying things...1. Sometimes you might find Jay like a kid praising teacher to get extra marks or get some chocolates.2. Don\\'t get me wrong... Without fail he has written few words about people who has acknowledged his book!3. Sometimes you might get a feel like, I should become famous within 5 years & Jay will write about me4. You\\'ll definitely find stuff you might not want to take from a book.Do you want to become rich or make him rich...1. It\\'s obvious, like in almost all the books, you\\'ll find some marketing stuff at the end of the book.2. There\\'s nothing wrong in that stuff but again are you ready to spend money to listen to him and to learn from him?3. If you read some other self help book or teachings of the people that this book relies on; you\\'ll notice that you\\'re drawn towards meditation, positive thinking, changing lifestyle...4. Unfortunately this book has the tendency to draw readers more towards Jay rather than meditation or mindfulness...5. It\\'s like a fitness trainer inviting you to gym.. but rather than guiding you to exercise and get fit, the trainer is more interested in selling supplements!Still if you\\'re reading this review...1. Go ahead and grab a copy of this book.2. Suppose, if you\\'re surrounded by people who give you advice, & you don\\'t know how they became instant genius, chances are they might have read something from this book or anything from similar books3. A must read for readers who wants to know what\\'s the current trend in the self help category...Simple advice...1. I followed few rules which I have broken when I bought this book..2. Here\\'s the rule: When it comes to self help, inspiration or mindfulness buy the book written by the person who\\'s an expert in that field, maybe a doctor, or phycologist, or someone who\\'s known for their specific talent like music, etc...3. Another rule of thumb... It\\'s better to buy self help book written by someone who\\'s already dead or someone who\\'s about to die. It\\'s because you have their whole life before you before buying their books!I think this is my first review....Why I\\'m reviewing this book?Honestly I\\'m disappointed. But still it\\'s not a bad book and it\\'s not a great book. It\\'s definitely not as advertised!If you\\'re ready to follow Jay then you can buy this book and do whatever he suggests in the book.Closing thoughts...Once you start reading this book you\\'ll get a feel like maybe you\\'re eating up huge variety of foods & you couldn\\'t identify what you are tasting!Reading this book is like getting a taste of all the Indian food + Chinese food + Western food + some food from sky!Finally...While reading this book be ready to get interrupted by Jay himself through some social media!Still why I bought this book...1. I\\'m surrounded by people who can speak almost about anything after watching a movie or a 5 minute video... I\\'m sure they gonna quote from this book!2. I like how Jay sold so much copies of this book! Most likely he has planned everything ahead while releasing his first video!Finally reason for my fictional name...1. I just don\\'t want people to get caught up in something popular & lose interest in their pursuit of becoming more mindful, positive, financially well, etc!2. Actual reason for this name...Just search in your favourite search engine, \"what was the first program written in C by it\\'s founders?\"3. Yup, I like programming that\\'s why I have created this fictional name.4. Guys if you\\'re really fed up with life, don\\'t give up. Start learning a programming language. Just print hello world...Why everyone should print hello world...1. Hello world is a way of checking if the IDE or code editor is installed correctly in the computer.2. As you make more hello world programs, you\\'ll either stick with 1 programming language or you\\'ll develop interest to learn more programming languages3. You\\'ll start to understand how computer behaves and understands everything as 0s and 1s...Finally...1. Is this really a book review?2. Don\\'t you feel sleepy or annoying?3. This\\' how you might feel like while reading this book.4. If you\\'re an avid reader and want to read something that will have an lasting impact on your life, please don\\'t start with this book!5. Then what to buy since you\\'ve some amount of money to buy a book: Maybe you could buy a book written by a real monk!6. Either agree or disagree: Basic always remains the same. You might see changes in the format or in the way of presentation.7. If you\\'ve read the previous statement and agreed you will not invest so much on self help books. You might prefer audio books or ebooks as they\\'re relatively cheap & don\\'t take up space in your bookshelf!Think before buying anything....\\n',\n",

The author had written a great book of life full of lessons.It is written on the back of this book that \" this book is probably the best self help book ever written\"  i agree with that line and support it.This book was published in 1940\\'s ,a bit old book but had every bit of relevant and eternal information which we think of now and ever.THINK AND GROW RICH was the title of the book but reading this book twice I came to know that lot more titles suit this book and a few I thought were THINK AND GROW PERSONALITY THINK AND GROW CHARACTER THINK AND GROW WISDOM THINK AND GROW MOTIVATION.Fabulous book and continuing to admire the work.\\n',\n",
              "  '\\n  When you face criticism in your life try to turn the pages in this book you will find some way to cope it up and move on in your destination in whatever sector you are working in. It helped me a lot only by reading few pages as I have not completed this book. One thing is pretty much sure about this book is that if you want to make your dream come true then you must be PRACTICAL otherwise it will be in your WISH LIST and will never fulfill your desire.\\n'],\n",
